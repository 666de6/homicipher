## About This Game

Homicipher is a female-targeted language deciphering and exploration ADV based on the concept of "romance with horror men." The protagonist, who has wandered into another world, interacts with non-human beings to decipher their language while striving to escape.

![](https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2302660/extras/catchphrase_EN.png?t=1731827710)When the protagonist wakes up, they find themselves lost in a different world. As they learn the words of the mysterious monsters that speak a strange language, they search for a way to escape. Along the way, will they fall in love with the monster men who come to their aid...? Really?

In this alternate world, a different language is used. Players will interpret and dechiper characters' words through expressions, gestures and the objects they point to.

The language of this world isn’t as refined as human languages. One meaning is concentrated in one word, with almost no particles; a string of words conveys only a rough meaning.

# Homicipher is a clever horror game about female desire and monster language

[Cass Marshall](https://www.polygon.com/authors/cass-marshall) is a news writer focusing on gaming and culture coverage, taking a particular interest in the human stories of the wild world of online games.

Being lost in a dark and unfamiliar location is a common fear, and a great start to a horror game. Filling that place with weird, menacing monsters is even better. One horror game adds another novel twist to the formula: I have no idea what anyone is saying, and I have to piece this strange, foreign language together before I’m viciously murdered. Welcome to [_Homicipher_, a “female-targeted language deciphering and exploration ADV based on the concept of ‘romance with horror men.](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701642&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2302660%2FHomicipher%2F)’” I’ve never played anything like it.

_Homicipher_ starts out with a very simple premise: I’m alone in a new place, I’ve lost my bag, and I’m in a rusted-out old hallway with flickering lights and a hunched, menacing figure called Mr. Crawling. I sprint away, only to be confronted by Mr. Hood, a Grim Reaper-style specter. Luckily, Mr. Hood is much nicer than his colleague, and we take part in a little impromptu language lesson. He teaches me a few basic words like “me” and “you” before I stumble onto the next hallway.

Gameplay wise, _Homicipher_ is super simple. I click down the paths I want to explore, hoping I don’t get murdered. I’m no [Leon S. Kennedy](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23643823/resident-evil-4-remake-review-capcom-ps5) or even a [James Sunderland](https://www.polygon.com/review/460647/silent-hill-2-sh2-remake-review-ps5-pc); if I approach a nasty monster in the dark, I’m probably going to get murdered and sent back to the last checkpoint. I also have to make a solid attempt to communicate where I can. It’s only through dialogue, context clues, and trust that I can begin to understand the blunt, coarse language of this new world.  

[![Mr. Crawling, a figure with only arms and part of the face visible beneath a black robe, tries to communicate with the player. The player has logged their language as potentially saying “you not from here?”](https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Untitled-design-2024-11-06T111634.079.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)](https://platform.polygon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Untitled-design-2024-11-06T111634.079.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100)

Every time I’m exposed to a new word, I can open up my log and mark down a guess as to what it means. That log is saved, and the next time a phrase comes up in dialogue, my English note will be marked above it. At one point, I approached a red-lit door, and Mr. Crawling hissed a short phrase. Thanks to my hard linguistic studies, I knew exactly what he was saying: “should not open door.” Thanks for the tip, buddy — that’s one brutal murder I got to avoid!

You may notice that Mr. Crawling started out as an antagonist, but he developed into being a protective figure of sorts. _Homicipher_ plays with the visual novel tropes of monstrous, attractive men, but the language barrier makes things more complex and intriguing. Some of these strange figures are patient, taking the time to teach the protagonist a few key vocabulary words. Others are impatient; if I smile at the wrong point in the conversation, or refuse to take some advice, it can be a death sentence.

This is ultimately a low-stress horror game, which I appreciate — it’s scary, but in a chill sort of way. Every jump scare or death sequence resets back to an earlier stage of exploration, and I can regularly stop to check my conversation log and see if I can puzzle out any other vocabulary phrases. It’s a very interesting trick that I haven’t seen a horror game attempt before, and it adds a whole new dimension to exploration that I really enjoyed. All the sexy monster boys are just a sinister bonus.

#### **ABOUT THE GAME**

**Homicipher** is a point-and-click ADV horror game that lets you, as the protagonist, decipher and learn a new in-game language through interacting with various characters. By interpreting the gestures and expressions of the otherworldly beings you meet in the game, you begin to understand their language and their meaning; learn to communicate with them, and maybe…_just maybe,_ even get romantically involved.👀

First off, just a few disclaimers: the developers did not advertise this game as “otome,” but rather used “**_女性向け (joseimuke),_** _**language decoding horror/escape ADV game**_” as this title’s category. So please keep this in mind in case you are expecting the game to follow an _otomege_ format with full-blown romance routes _(it does not)._

#### **FEATURES**

- **Point-and-click adventure game:** Investigate items on screen and learn new words while trying to engage in conversations with the characters.
- **Reaction choices:** React by smiling or frowning at the characters _(similar to Sympathy Kiss react/emoji choices)._
- **Action choices:** During your gameplay, you’ll be given options to take certain actions with consequences, such as _opening a door, answering the phone, sitting down, using a crowbar, etc._
- **34 Endings** _(not counting ‘mistake ends’ aka the dead ends)._
- **Dictionary**: As you decipher the monsters’ languages, you can record and edit them in the game’s in-game dictionary, which is accessible anytime through the options menu.

---

#### **CHARACTERS**

![](https://otomekitten.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/e69687e5ad97e58c96e58c96efbc9ahomicipher-14_11_2024-9_32_42-pm.jpeg?w=760)

While there’s a lot of characters in this game, you only get the chance to “spend time” with six of them: _Mr. Silvair, Mr. Crawling, Mr. Gap, Mr. Hood, Mr. Machete, and Mr. Chopped._

_Mr. Scarletella_ is more or less the antagonist in the story, but he’s definitely one of the main characters too. So, in total, you could say that all **seven** of these characters will have their own route-specific endings in the game.

I played blind throughout my entire gameplay, and I had a lot of fun with it this way. The game is quite forgiving when it comes to retracing your steps to previous scenes in case you stumbled on one of their numerous _‘mistake ends’_. _I can definitely say, this is one of those adv games where you just have to go with your gut!_

**DISCLAIMER:** _**The contents below may contain mild spoilers for the game, so please tread or skim with caution. Below are all my unfiltered reactions and impressions of the characters, which I wrote in draft form while playing Homicipher so just a heads up: it might be a little more informal than my usual reviews! 😂**_

#### **MR. SILVAIR**

- _Silvair-sensei_ 😳👉👈
- _a good husbando_ 🥺

![](https://otomekitten.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/e69687e5ad97e58c96e58c96efbc9ahomicipher-13_11_2024-10_00_47-pm.jpeg?w=760)

Mr. Silvair gave off a very sensei-like vibe. Besides _Mr. Hood_, he was the character who taught you the most of their language effectively! _I filled out most of the entries in my dictionary because of him._ He made the deciphering process so easy because he literally teaches you the language in the most _hand-holdy_ way possible. _Gotta love that about him!_ He also makes it a point to constantly remind you that he likes to “research” or “study” and even hints that he enjoys “researching/studying” your body, which is kinda hot, _ngl (yes, I’m totally taking this out of context, lol)._ 😂

Tbh, I thought he was going to be standoffish, just like the vibe he was giving off at first, but he turned out to be such a pookie bear. _Aww. Okay, Silvair-sensei, I see you, babe!_

⬇️ **_Spoilers_**

#### **MR. CHOPPED**

- _lowkey himbo_
- _genki (when he’s not being bullied_)🥺

![](https://otomekitten.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/e69687e5ad97e58c96e58c96efbc9ahomicipher-10_11_2024-6_49_59-pm.jpeg?w=760)

_Poor Mr. Chopped just can’t catch a break!_ I feel so bad for him whenever the other monsters pick on him. Just leave this poor man—_er…_head alone, _dammit_!😭 I’m glad he found friends in Mr. Silvair and Mr. Crawling, and that they’re actually there to help him around. His cute quirk is that he’s a little high-maintenance with his hair and loves getting haircuts_! Lol, I find that pretty adorbs!_

⬇️ **_Spoilers_**

#### **MR. HOOD**

- _kuudere_, _oniisan vibes_
- _*also a pookie bear*_

![](https://otomekitten.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/e69687e5ad97e58c96e58c96efbc9ahomicipher-14_11_2024-1_34_15-am.jpeg?w=760)

Mr. Hood honestly surprised me. You meet him in the very first chapters of the game, and he teaches you a thing or two about their world’s language. But then, after going through the maze, you sort of forget about him. So when he actually showed up in the later chapters, I had to do a double take and was like: _“Oh right, him!”_😂 I didn’t realize he even had a route until he started helping you out more. To me, Mr. Hood gives off major _oniisan_ vibes—_very overprotective, always there to help_, _always staying true to his word_. And his _kuudere_ personality had me totally smitten!

⬇️ **_Spoilers_**

#### **MR. CRAWLING**

- _wife_
- _best boy!_

![](https://otomekitten.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/e69687e5ad97e58c96e58c96efbc9ahomicipher-14_11_2024-9_38_42-pm.jpeg?w=760)

_Honestly, a well-deserved poster boy!_ Mr. Crawling is your ultimate ride-or-die _homie/boyfie/wifey_, whatever you wanna call him! He doesn’t mind it; in fact, he _wants_ to be your ultimate _homie/boyfie/wifey_ and will make sure you’re taken care of, the best way possible! He’s just as much of a main character in the game, alongside the MC. _I mean, he does have the most endings_. Probably because he’s always by your side, _and always at your beck and call too! Dude just loves you so much and would do anything for you!_

I am normally not big on the most “hyped” characters in the fandom, so I was pretty skeptical about Mr. Crawling at first. But after playing through all of _Homicpher_ and completing all of the game’s endings, I can certainly say…_yeah, the hype was very much deserved! No lies detected!_

⬇️ **_Spoilers_**

#### **MR. MACHETE**

- _big body, big… heart ❤_
- _very lowkey gap moe_

![](https://otomekitten.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/e69687e5ad97e58c96e58c96efbc9ahomicipher-13_11_2024-9_52_19-pm.jpeg?w=760)

_Mr. Machete_ is defo the _“Might Makes Right”_ kind of guy! His character absolutely embodies this trope! At first, he really doesn’t care about you. He’ll tell you he’s “bored,” sometimes challenge you to fight him, and then lose interest again if you ignore him. I also see him as a bit of a _glory hound_, only showing interest in others if they prove to meet his standards strength-wise.

That’s why, in his route, you actually have to prove to him that you’re _sTrOnK af!_ And only then does he start seeing you as someone he can care about. _Damn, bro’s got some standards, huh?_😅 I gotta say, I surprisingly enjoyed his route! _It was fun following him around while he just straight up ignores the heck outta you!_ 😂

⬇️ **_Spoilers_**

#### **MR. GAP**

- _underrated_
- _chaotic_
- _also best boy ==(accdg to me)==_

![](https://otomekitten.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/e69687e5ad97e58c96e58c96efbc9ahomicipher-12_11_2024-10_34_41-pm.jpeg?w=760)

While everyone’s on the _Mr. Crawling_ _hype-train_, _Mr. Gap_, was actually my MVP! He’s a weird one—v_ery red-flag, very chaoti_c, but he gets the job done! In fact, he’s the one who mostly helps you in ***_life-or-death situations! ==(more on spoilers)==_ Sure, he loves getting something in return, but he’s true to his word. If he says he’ll help you, _**he most definitely will**_—and in the most efficient way possible!

He was also the one giving MC (you) clues about yourself, your backstory, and the like! Honestly, Mr. Gap is so great, and I’m sad he’s so underrated…😔

⬇️ **_Spoilers_**

#### **MR. SCARLETELLA**

- 🚩🚩🚩
- _sus_

![](https://otomekitten.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/e69687e5ad97e58c96e58c96efbc9ahomicipher-12_11_2024-9_48_09-pm.jpeg?w=760)

_Who is Mr. Scarletella? And why is he so obsessed with you?_ Is there any connection between him and MC? I played through all the endings, hoping to uncover more about him, but aside from a few tidbits here and there about his role in the story, my questions about his identity and motives remain unanswered, which was a bit disappointing. That said, I did enjoy the chase scenes with him!

⬇️ **_Spoilers_**

#### **TRAILER**

---

#### **OVERALL THOUGHTS**

I checked my hours on Steam and was quite surprised to see that I clocked around _15 hours_ in my gameplay of _Homicipher_. I was going at it blind, and didn’t look up any guides until I hit a roadblock and literally couldn’t figure out how to unlock End16! _That was bonkers!_

---

I initially played the game demo back in 2023 when it first came out but was really disappointed by how it all played out. Unaware of the game’s mechanics, _I guess I was just very confused at that time_ and even felt annoyed by how everyone grandiosely hyped it up as _“horror otome,”_ when, to be honest, it felt more like a _point-and-click adventure game_, similar to _Amnesia: The Dark Descent._ That disappointment made me avoid the game this year, and I even refused to talk about it, because I didn’t wanna be a _sourpuss_ among the excited users surrounding its hype. _**OH BOY I AM SO GLAD I GAVE THIS ANOTHER CHANCE!**_

When I played the demo last year, I didn’t realize that you actually had to decipher the language in the game. I was also playing with my _ally_ docked on the TV, so I clearly didn’t know I had to click on the lines/phrases and type-in my _guessed_ words. _So yeah, that was defo a big user error on my part!_ _Oops!_ _==(I am not the smartest soldier I fear)==_ 😂 Once I got the hang of how the mechanics worked though, it was actually so much fun! _**Deciphering all them odd symbols and phrases, just so you can communicate with your ghoulish husbando, is quite an endearing task, don’t you think?**_ They also practically spoon-feed you when it comes to teaching/learning their language, which I’m quite grateful for in this game.

![](https://otomekitten.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/screenshot-14_11_2024-9_15_46-pm.jpeg?w=760)

The atmosphere and setting of the game were so immersive that I literally binged it for 4 hours straight until I reached my first ending. However, while the gameplay was a fun experience, the story is far from perfect. There are no backstories for the characters, and the lore feels very surface-level. Any attempts to explore it remain quite vague, which was a little disappointing for anyone who wants to dive deeper into the characters and the MC.

_**Some of my other small gripes are as follows:**_

- _No CGs/Gallery._
- the endings aren’t quite satisfying.
- Replayability can be a hit or miss for some. While the game is generous in letting you retrace chapters to reach certain endings, many hidden choices are hard to find without a proper guide. So, it definitely requires a lot of patience if you’re playing it blind.
- There were some translations that were awkwardly phrased, _but because it’s not a text heavy game, this became a non-issue to me._

**How are the _jumpscares_ for this game?**  
While there are a decent amount of jumpscares in the game, I personally didn’t find it that scary. Athough, please take this with a large grain of salt coming from someone who generally loves the horror genre. The game is definitely eerie! _Heck, the entire atmosphere in Homicipher is eerie_, which I believe adds to its charm. So, if you’re someone who can stomach _“eerie”_ and a few jumpscares, I think you’ll be fine. However, if you’re not good with horror games at all and didn’t like, say… _that single jumpscare in Kureha’s route in 9RIP_, I probably wouldn’t recommend this game to you!

## **All the Characters Are Your Pookie Bears!**

I believe the game taps into a player’s _sense of surprise_, not so much through its plot, but by catching your expectations off guard.  
  
_What do I mean by this?_ Despite the monstrous appearance of all the characters, the game manages to make you care about them by showcasing moments where their true, more human qualities are revealed. These characters, who may at first seem frightening or even repulsive, are gradually shown in a more endearing light through your interactions with them as MC.  
  
Come to think of it, _It’s quite a clever contrast, no?_ You’re initially confronted with these horrifying creatures, but as you progress, the game slowly peels back layers of their personalities, revealing softer, more human sides, making you feel attached to them in ways you didn’t anticipate.🥺

![](https://otomekitten.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/e69687e5ad97e58c96e58c96efbc9ahomicipher-14_11_2024-7_46_44-pm.jpeg?w=760)

I loved all of the characters in Homicipher, but my personal favorite was _Mr. Gap!_ He was too clever, and too wise for his own good!😌

Of course, no one can deny that _Mr. Crawling_ was best boy indeed. He was the perfect wife, and truly deserving of being the poster boy in this game!

**Character Ranking:**

**_Mr. Gap > Mr. Crawling > Mr. Hood > Mr. Silvair = Mr. Machete >>> Mr. Scarletella = Mr. Chopped_**

I do stand by what the devs said though, that this isn’t an otome game. They were right to categorize it as _joseimuke_ because the relationships here can be seen as either romantic or platonic. It all depends on the player’s interpretation; whether you view _Mr. Crawling_ and the others as liking you romantically or in a purely friendship-based way.

---

**Does Homicpher live up to its hype?**  
_Yes and no._ Yes, in the sense that it does something different by steering away from the traditional romance-focused dating sim. And no, because while it’s a fun point-and-click game with unexpectedly endearing characters, it’s pretty much just that. It lacks a compelling lore that could have elevated the characters further. The game is far from being a “dating sim masterpiece”, and calling it the _best romance dating sim ever_ feels like subjectively over-praising it _(to me anyway)._

I do understand the hype surrounding this game though! A lot of us want to experience something new, and that’s where _Homicipher_ really stands out. It offers a fresh take on dating sims, which is what ultimately makes this game so unique and very engaging. Deciphering the words adds a layer of entertainment to the gameplay, and the carefully thought-out, likable characters, _plus the horror setting_ are the cherry on top! _It’s undoubtedly deserving of praise on that front._

---

**Do I recommend this game?** **YES.**  
To be honest, I’m not even sure why I wrote this review. The game is already so popular that it doesn’t need my input to help it get noticed. _But Idk, after 100% completing it, I just felt compelled to jot down all my thoughts. Full stop. I guess I was really enjoying this title that much, huh?_ 😅 If that doesn’t say enough, I’ll add that I went into this game expecting overhyped edginess, but what I got instead were unexpected moments of fluffy endearment and the chance to discover seven lovely pookie bears along the way!🥺😭 _So yeah, I really like Homicipher._ The plot, or lack thereof, may not be the best, but the characters really drive this game home! For horror fans who also love romance, this is definitely a great game to indulge in!
