Introduction
For when you just really need to know what your spooky crush said to you.

This guide was compiled over many hours of play, context comparison, and cross-referencing. The words and usages may not always be perfect, but should convey the accurate essence of meaning. You can always swap out words and phrases for synonyms that you enjoy more (I personally like using "that one" in place of "them" just for funsies), but I mostly chose words or phrases that were the simplest and what I felt were most accurate for this guide.

Shout-out to the toughest phrase/word for me to choose the meaning of, which was "troubled" LOL. It's used in so many different contexts, I struggled with it for a bit before deciding it felt the most correct for now.

I hope this reference is helpful to the community! Feel free to leave me your thoughts, and I greatly appreciate any likes and comments. Most of all, have fun!

[EDIT 5/11/2024] Changed the following words as a result of feedback from Kay down in the comments. Thanks Kay!
pg. 3 "very long" to "pass"; pg. 4 "investigate" to "research"; pg. 5 "rearrange" to "shake"; pg. 6 "injury" to "problem"; pg. 9 "appearing" to "same"
